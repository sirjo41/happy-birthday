            <p>
                My love, this past year with you has been nothing short of amazing. Every moment, every laugh, every challenge, has only made my feelings for you stronger. You’ve brought so much joy into my life, and on this special day, I want to remind you just how much you mean to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter the ups and downs we've faced, my love for you has never wavered. I know that together we can overcome anything, because our bond is unbreakable. You are my world, my everything, and I feel so lucky to call you mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we celebrate your birthday, I also celebrate the beautiful memories we’ve created and the many more we'll make in the future. You are the reason my heart races, and every day with you feels like a gift. I’m so grateful for your love, your strength, and your constant presence in my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love you, now and forever. Happy Birthday, my beautiful. Let’s conquer the world, side by side.
            </p>
            <p>Your forever test, <span class="signature">test</span></p>
